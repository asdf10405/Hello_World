荃者所以在鱼，得鱼而忘荃；
蹄者所以在兔，得兔而忘蹄；
言者所以在意，得意而忘言。————庄子·外物
A basket-trap is for catching fish,but when one has got the fish,one need think no more about the basket.
A foot-trap is for catching hares,but when one has got the hare,one need think no more about the trap.
Words are for holding ideas,but when one has got the idea,one need no longer think about the words.
